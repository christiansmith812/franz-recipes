# Franz 5 - Plugins/Recipes
[Franz 5](https://github.com/meetfranz/franz) plugins are now called __recipes__.

## How to install a recipe
In Franz 5, recipes are now served via a central repository. Except for development purposes you don't need to manually install a recipe any longer.

__To add a new service:__
* Go to your Franz 5 App
* Search & add the required service
* Et voila, simple as that!

## How to develop, test and deploy recipes
